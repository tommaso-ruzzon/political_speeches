I hope the following Colab notebooks effectively showcase my work in Python, focusing on the analysis and classification of German political speeches and surveys. These notebooks are part of a larger project aimed at understanding political discourse through the application of Natural Language Processing techniques. At the top of each notebook, you'll find a brief description of the specific tasks being performed.
